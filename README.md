## Project Structure


Note: The frontend design for the task list, has been borrowed from https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react, which is under [MIT License](https://github.com/astejs/todomvc/blob/master/license.md) as it looked pretty nice. (**Only** the frontend design, and after some good hours adapting it for my case)
